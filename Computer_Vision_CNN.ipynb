These 3 dimensions are as follows:\n","- image height\n","- image width\n","- color channels\n","\n","The only item in the list above you may not understand is **color channels**. The number of color channels represents the depth of an image and coorelates to the colors used in it. For example, an image with three channels is likely made up of rgb (red, green, blue) pixels. So, for each pixel we have three numeric values in the range 0-255 that define its color. For an image of color depth 1 we would likely have a greyscale image with one value defining each pixel, again in the range of 0-255.\n","\n","![alt text](http://xrds.acm.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Figure1.png)\n","\n","Keep this in mind as we discuss how our network works and the input/output of each layer. \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9mqznmTh--v2"},"source":["##Convolutional Neural Network\n","**Note:** I will use the term *convnet* and convolutional neural network interchangably.\n","\n","Each convolutional neural network is made up of one or many convolutional layers. These layers are different than the *dense* layers we have seen previously. Their goal is to find patterns from within images that can be used to classify the image or parts of it. But this may sound familiar to what our densly connected neural network in the previous section was doing, well that's becasue it is. \n","\n","The fundemental difference between a dense layer and a convolutional layer is that dense layers detect patterns globally while convolutional layers detect patterns locally. When we have a densly connected layer each node in that layer sees all the data from the previous layer. This means that this layer is looking at all the information and is only capable of analyzing the data in a global capacity. Our convolutional layer however will not be densly connected, this means it can detect local patterns using part of the input data to that layer.\n","\n","*Let's have a look at how a densly connected layer would look at an image vs how a convolutional layer would.*\n","\n","This is our image; the goal of our network will be to determine whether this image is a cat or not.\n","![alt text](https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/reference_guide/cat_weight_ref_guide/1800x1200_cat_weight_ref_guide.jpg)\n","\n","**Dense Layer:** A dense layer will consider the ENTIRE image.

This means if a pattern that the network knows is present in a different area of the image it will have to learn the pattern again in that new area to be able to detect it. \n","\n","*Let's use an example to better illustrate this.*\n","\n","We'll consider that we have a dense neural network that has learned what an eye looks like from a sample of dog images.\n","\n","![alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=16FJKkVS_lZToQOCOOy6ohUpspWgtoQ-c)\n","\n","Let's say it's determined that an image is likely to be a dog if an eye is present in the boxed off locations of the image above.\n","\n","Now let's flip the image.\n","![alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1V7Dh7BiaOvMq5Pm_jzpQfJTZcpPNmN0W)\n","\n","Since our densly connected network has only recognized patterns globally it will look where it thinks the eyes should be present. Clearly it does not find them there and therefore would likely determine this image is not a dog. Even though the pattern of the eyes is present, it's just in a different location.\n","\n","Since convolutional layers learn and detect patterns from different areas of the image, they don't have problems with the example we just illustrated. They know what an eye looks like and by analyzing different parts of the image can find where it is present. \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"20J29gz-NroA"},"source":["###Multiple Convolutional Layers\n","In our models it is quite common to have more than one convolutional layer. Even the basic example we will use in this guide will be made up of 3 convolutional layers. These layers work together by increasing complexity and abstraction at each subsequent layer. The first layer might be responsible for picking up edges and short lines, while the second layer will take as input these lines and start forming shapes or polygons. Finally, the last layer might take these shapes and determine which combiantions make up a specific image.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ii-a9rXzRwNi"},"source":["##Feature Maps\n","You may see me use the term *feature map* throughout this tutorial. This term simply stands for a 3D tensor with two spacial axes (width and height) and one depth axis. Our convolutional layers take feature maps as their input and return a new feature map that reprsents the prescence of spcific filters from the previous feature map. These are what we call *response maps*."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OScABB-ScXHx"},"source":["##Layer Parameters\n","A convolutional layer is defined by two key parameters.\n","\n","####**Filters**\n","A filter is a m x n pattern of pixels that we are looking for in an image. The number of filters in a convolutional layer reprsents how many patterns each layer is looking for and what the depth of our response map will be. If we are looking for 32 different patterns/filters than our output feature map (aka the response map) will have a depth of 32. Each one of the 32 layers of depth will be a matrix of some size containing values indicating if the filter was present at that location or not.\n","\n","Here's a great illustration from the book \"Deep Learning with Python\" by Francois Chollet (pg 124).\n","![alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1HcLvvLKvLCCGuGZPMvKYz437FbbCC2eB)\n","\n","####**Sample Size**\n","This isn't really the best term to describe this, but each convolutional layer is going to examine n x m blocks of pixels in each image.

This size will be the same as the size of our filter. \n","\n","Our layers work by sliding these filters of n x m pixels over every possible position in our image and populating a new feature map/response map indicating whether the filter is present at each location. \n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vnzqr8Dzjchd"},"source":["##Borders and Padding\n","The more mathematical of you may have realized that if we slide a filter of let's say size 3x3 over our image well consider less positions for our filter than pixels in our input.

They work in a similar way to convolutional layers where they extract windows from the feature map and return a response map of the max, min or average values of each channel.
